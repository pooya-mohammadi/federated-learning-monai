# Introduction
In this project, I try to present the examples in 
`nvflare` with `monai` in an easy manner for all the users, especially Windows users.

# simulator_cifar_10
In this example, we will use the `nvflare's simulator` to train a model on the `cifar-10` dataset.
The instructions are provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/pooya-mohammadi/federated-learning-monai-nvflare/tree/main/nvflare_tests/simulator_cifar_10) file of the `simulator_cifar_10` folder.
